<b><i><u>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio (Pasta with Garlic & Olive Oil)</u></i></b>
<!-- FINAL_IMAGE -->

<b>Time & Difficulty</b>: 15 min | Easy

<b>Ingredients</b>:
- 200 g pasta (spaghetti or any you have)
- 3–4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced or minced
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- Salt & pepper

<b>Instructions</b>:
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Cook your pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve a little pasta water.
2. While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil gently in a large pan over medium-low heat.
3. Add the sliced garlic. Sauté slowly so it becomes golden but not brown—nobody wants bitter garlic!
4. When the pasta is ready, drain it (save about 50 ml of pasta water).
5. Toss the drained pasta directly into the pan with your golden garlic and oil.
6. Toss well, adding a bit of the reserved pasta water to help the magic happen—the sauce will cling to the pasta beautifully!
7. Season generously with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.  

<b>Tips / Variations</b>:
- If you want a little “kick," add a pinch of chili flakes when you cook the garlic!
- Craving green? Add some chopped parsley if you have it—if not, pretend you did, nobody will know…
- Serve with a big smile and maybe an apron for a real trattoria vibe!
